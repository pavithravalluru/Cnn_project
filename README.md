# Cnn_project
🛰️ CNN-Based Satellite Image Reconstruction

📌 Introduction

This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for reconstructing and enhancing the quality of satellite images. The model integrates perceptual loss and MSE loss to preserve visual details while improving pixel accuracy. Performance is evaluated using PSNR and SSIM metrics. This work has been published in IEEE, highlighting its contribution to satellite image processing and restoration.
